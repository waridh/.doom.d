#+title: README
* Quick Setup instructions
** Prerequisites
1. Make sure that you have a stable version of emacs install. Preferably a version that is higher than 29.3
2. Have Git install, but it is likely that you do have it.
3. Use Linux or WSL. Windows does not play nicely at all with Doom emacs, and you will have a better time using WSL.
   1. This will give you GNU find as well.
4. Install *ripgrep* through *cargo* -> means that you should also install rustup on your system
** Installation
#+begin_src bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
#+end_src

Following this, add ~~/.config/emacs/bin~ to path.

Now we can remove the default doom configuration and add the one from this repository with the following command.
*** Linux
#+begin_src bash
# Need to remove the default doom configuration to make room for ours
rm -rf ~/.config/doom
git clone git@github.com:waridh/.doom.d.git ~/.config/doom
#+end_src
